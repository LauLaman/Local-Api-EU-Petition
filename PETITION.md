# Petition - Smart Home: Local Control, Continuity, and Security

###### Sumery
We call upon the European Union to enact legislation mandating smart home device manufacturers to provide accessible local APIs. This ensures user control without dependence on external servers, coupled with stringent security standards. Additionally, we advocate for manufacturers to release open-source firmware when support ceases, ensuring device longevity and empowering users.


##### We:
Users and advocates for smart home technology, seeking legislation to safeguard our rights and enhance the security of smart technologies.

##### Observing that:
Smart home devices often lack accessible local APIs, restricting user control. Dependence on external servers poses privacy risks and jeopardizes device functionality in cases of business insolvency or discontinued support.

##### We Request:
1. **Accessibility of All Features via Local API** Manufacturers must make all functionalities of their smart home devices available through local APIs.

2. **Security and Updates** Manufacturers should regularly release security updates for local APIs to ensure user privacy and device security.

3. **No exclusivety** Manufacturers should NOT only make certain features available on cloud services. All features should be available on the local API.

4. **Open-source Firmware Post-Support** In the event of discontinued support, manufacturers must release the firmware as open source, allowing the open-source community to continue development.

These measures will not only enhance individual control but also ensure the continuity of smart home devices, even under adverse conditions like business insolvency or discontinued support.
